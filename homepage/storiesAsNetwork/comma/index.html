<h1>What does a comma do?</h1>

<p>As I say commas are servile and they have no life of their own, and their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing oneâ€™s own interest and I do decidedly like to like my own interest my own interest in what I am doing. A comma by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to me for many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do not pay as much attention to them, the use of them was positively degrading. Let me tell you what I feel and what I mean and what I felt and what I meant.

When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans, verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me. 

The longer, the more complicated the sentence the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another, the more the very more I had of them the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves by themselves and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.
<span style="float:right;width:300px;
 padding-right:40px">an abomination such as a comma is what makes it possible for a sentence to go on and on like the one you just skipped past. Yes, i know you skipped past it, i mean who has time to read all that?<br>Do you see now why I feel about the comma as I did and as I do. <br><button class="button">NEXT <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/question-mark/index.html"></button>
