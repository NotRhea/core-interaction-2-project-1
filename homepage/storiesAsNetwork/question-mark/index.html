  <div class="container">

      <span class="visible">The question mark is </span> <span class="blacked-out">alright when it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected with writing it is completely entirely </span> <span class="visible">completely uninteresting</span> <span class="blacked-out">It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing. Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the question mark. Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear </span> <span class="visible">and</span> <span class="blacked-out">will</span>  <span class="visible">unnecessary.</span><span class="blacked-out">name of something. A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is a question and so why add to it the question mark when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing. Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it. So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious, and so we do not have to go any farther into that. There are besides dashes and dots, and these might be interesting spaces might be interesting. They might if one felt that way about them. </span>
